The design of the modern Windows sound system is fairly simple.
Microsoft even has a diagram of how sound flows through the system.[1][ms-diagram]

So what do you need for bit-perfect audio?
It does depend on the system, but let's use a fairly standard setup:

* Input: FLAC (16-bit @ 44100Hz)
* Output: S/PDIF



My configuration:

* Input: FLAC, 16-bit, 44100Hz
* Output: S/PDIF (over optical) to the DAC
